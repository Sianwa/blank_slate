// simple const file with all your apps route names
// the two main sections are:
// path: which defines the route structure in your app (e.g., /login, /users/:id)
// It's what gets matched when navigating by full string path.
// name: An identifier you assign to a route
// Makes it easier to navigate using parameters (especially dynamic ones).
// Better for refactoring and managing deep links, since youâ€™re not tied to literal paths.


//TODO: Add paths and routes
// .i.e const String signIn = "signIn";
// .i.e const String signInPath = "/signIn";
// how to reference in code: context.pushNamed(signIn);
